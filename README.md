# Stapler

For over 3,000 years scientists have always asked the same 3 questions: "How can we go to the stars?", "Can we achieve eternal life', and, most important of them all, "What is the best angle to staple two pieces of paper together?". Today, one of these questions have been answered.

When two pieces of paper are stapled together the stapler is usually put on the top left side of the pages. This creates a minor loss of space in the triangle between the staple, top part, and the left part of the pages. Let's save some trees by wasting less paper. This massively important project aims to find the best angle in every point of an A4 paper so the least smallest posssible area is wasted.

The results may or (most likely) may not surprise you...
